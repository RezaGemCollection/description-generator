Once deployed, your app will be available at your Railway URL. You can then set up webhooks to trigger automatically when products are created/updated.

## Manual Webhook Setup

After deployment, you can create webhooks using:

```bash
# Create webhook for product creation
curl -X POST https://your-railway-url.com/webhooks/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"topic": "products/create", "address": "https://your-railway-url.com/webhooks/shopify"}'

# Create webhook for product updates
curl -X POST https://your-railway-url.com/webhooks/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"topic": "products/update", "address": "https://your-railway-url.com/webhooks/shopify"}'
```

## Testing After Deployment

1. Visit your Railway URL + `/health` to check if the app is running
2. Visit your Railway URL + `/test-connections` to test API connections
3. Create a product in Shopify and watch it get automated!

## Troubleshooting

- Check Railway logs for any errors
